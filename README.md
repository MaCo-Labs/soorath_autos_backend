🚗 Soorath Autos – Full Stack Car Dealership Platform
🚀 Overview
Soorath Autos is a full-stack web application developed for a real used car dealership in Muvattupuzha, Kerala. The platform allows users to browse, search, and view vehicle listings, while providing an admin system to manage inventory through a secure API-driven architecture.
🧱 Architecture
Frontend: React + Vite
Backend: Django + Django REST Framework
Database: PostgreSQL
